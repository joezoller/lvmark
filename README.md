# lvmark
lvmark is a single day project to emulate markdown inside of LabVIEW.  It takes a marked string, and performs
pattern matching to create property node text effects in a string indicator.

lvmark is a proof of concept, and rather limited by what LV can apply to a given string indicator, but
it's flexible enough to define new patterns for text effects.
