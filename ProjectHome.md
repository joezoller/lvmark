## A tool for handling inline markdown in LabVIEW strings ##


---


This is a one-day-of-coding effort to play with inline markdown.  It handles bold, italic, underline, and others.  Unfortunately, it is unable to handle the full markdown spec... LV doesn't have the capability to handle things like inline linking in strings.
